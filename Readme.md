# ØFFE website

This repository contains the website for Økologisk FødevareFællesskab Esbjerg, at the moment available at [øffe.tk](http://øffe.tk).

It uses plain html/javascript and utilizes [Leaflet](http://www.leafletjs.com) for showing an [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) with the location of ØFFE's food sources and pickup locations.

The current incarnation is mainly a proof-of-concept/leaflet playground being whirled into some kind of production state. It will probably transition to an [eggplant.dk](http://eggplant.dk) based site at some point.

# Requirements

A local Leaflet installation which can be established by running the install_leaflet.sh script which will fetch and decompress the leaflet distribution file.
